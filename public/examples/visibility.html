                <p>In this example, we use the <strong>show</strong> visibility classes to show certain strings of text based on the device on which users view a page. If their browser meets the class's conditions, the element will be shown. If not, it will be hidden.</p>

                <p>This example shows the opposite: It uses the <strong>hide</strong> visibility classes to state which elements should disappear based on your device's screen size or orientation. Users will see elements on every browser <strong>except</strong> those that meet these conditions.</p>

                <h2>Orientation Detection</h2>
                <p>This straightforward example shows how two strings of text determine whether or not an element is visible in different orientations. This will change on mobile devices when you rotate the device. On desktop, the orientation is almost always reported as landscape.</p>

                <h2>Accessibility</h2>
                <p>Adding <code>display: none</code> to an element will prevent screen readers from reading it. However, there are techniques to hide content while still making it readable by screen readers.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="row column">
                <h3>Show for Screen Readers Only</h3>
                <p>To visually hide content, while still allowing assistive technology to read it, add the class <code>show-for-sr</code>.</p>
                <div class="demo-panel">
                    <p class="show-for-sr">This text can only be read by a screen reader.</p>
                    <p>There's a line of text above this one, you just can't see it.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Hide for Screen Readers Only</h3>
                <p>To hide text from assistive technology, while still keeping it visible, add the attribute <code>aria-hidden="true"</code>. This doesn't affect how the element looks, but screen readers will skip over it.</p>
                <div class="demo-panel">
                    <p aria-hidden="true">This text can be seen, but won't be read by a screen reader.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Creating Skip Links</h3>
                <p>If your site has a lot of navigation, a screen reader will have to read through the entire navigation to get to your site's content. To remedy this, you can add a "skip link" at the very top of your page, which will send the user farther down the page, past the navigation when clicked on.</p>
                <p>Use the class <code>show-on-focus</code> to hide an element, except when it has focus.</p>
                <div class="demo-panel">
                    <p><a class="show-on-focus" href="#mainContent">Skip to Content</a></p>
                    <div id="mainContent"></div>
                </div>

                <h3>Responsive Visibility</h3>
                <p>Finally, if you want to hide some content but still make it accessible for screen readers, use the <strong>hidden</strong> visibility classes. Do not confuse these classes with <strong>hide</strong> visibility classes. Use these classes in conjunction with the <strong>hide</strong> and <strong>show</strong> visibility classes to control complex layouts while offering accessibility for those using screen readers.</p>
                <p class="demo-panel">
                    <span class="hidden-for-small-only">You are <em>not</em> on a small screen.</span>
                    <span class="hidden-for-medium-up">You are <em>not</em> on a medium, large, xlarge, or xxlarge screen.</span>
                    <span class="hidden-for-medium-only">You are <em>not</em> on a medium screen.</span>
                    <span class="hidden-for-large-up">You are <em>not</em> on a large, xlarge, or xxlarge screen.</span>
                    <span class="hidden-for-large-only">You are <em>not</em> on a large screen.</span>
                    <span class="hidden-for-xlarge-up">You are <em>not</em> on an xlarge screen and up.</span>
                    <span class="hidden-for-xlarge-only">You are <em>not</em> on an xlarge screen.</span>
                    <span class="hidden-for-xxlarge-up">You are <em>not</em> on an xxlarge screen.</span>
                </p>
                <p>To reverse the rules defined by <strong>hidden</strong>, use the <strong>visible</strong> visibility classes.</p>
                <p class="demo-panel">
                    <span class="visible-for-small-only">This text is shown only on a small screen.</span>
                    <span class="visible-for-medium-up">This text is shown on medium screens and up.</span>
                    <span class="visible-for-medium-only">This text is shown only on a medium screen.</span>
                    <span class="visible-for-large-up">This text is shown on large screens and up.</span>
                    <span class="visible-for-large-only">This text is shown only on a large screen.</span>
                    <span class="visible-for-xlarge-up">This text is shown on xlarge screens and up.</span>
                    <span class="visible-for-xlarge-only">This text is shown only on an xlarge screen.</span>
                    <span class="visible-for-xxlarge-up">This text is shown on xxlarge screens and up.</span>
