            <p>I'm a print/UI/UX designer and front end developer  based in Ludlow, Shropshire, just an hour's drive from Birmingham and the West Midlands and within shouting distance of Mid-Wales.</p>
            <p>I enjoy taking seemingly complex problems and transforming them into simple, easy to use solutions for both print and web. I work for companies of all shapes and sizes, from small local businesses to large brands and organisations. I can build you a website design you a logo or produce you a brochure, to your budget and timescales. </p>
            <p>So if you've got some marketing to do, or maybe a little bit of refreshment to your existing collateral, why not get in touch.</p>
